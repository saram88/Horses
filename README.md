# Horses


Have you ever wondered how many horse breeds there are on earth? Or maybe which horse Zorro rides on? In any case, you have come to the right place. In this quiz, you as a user get the opportunity to test your knowledge in order to develop your skills in horses!


## Features 

In this quiz, you as a user can gain a broader knowledge of horses, and things associated with horses. It makes you think, and maybe it challenges you a bit even if you are knowledgeable in the field of horses. It's not an ordinary quiz, it's a quiz that will make even the smartest horse head think!


### Existing Features

- Header and name.
  At the beginning of my page, the name of the Quiz is shown so that you can quickly see what it is about.

#### Divs classes ####
  In this section, the user should easily be able to get an overview of all the questions       asked. And then there is an accompanying image that gives a hint as to what the question       refers to

#### Submit ####
  The user must be able to easily submit the test, and this is done by clicking on the Submit   button. If the user presses the button before filling in an answer, the answer options will   light up in red. In the case of a red answer, they light up green.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea is to build the quiz whit more question and make it possible to select different areas of interest in which you want to develop your knowledge. Also to make it in new pages for each question so you get a easier way to watch the quiz. 



### Testing 

I've test-driven the page on validering.w3.org for both my html code and ccs styling. In addition to that, I have tested myself via browser tools for validation. Also have to test on my two different cell phone varieties as well as an ipad. MER?????

## Deployment

When I was inside my project, I went to the little tab called "Settings". From here I pressed the small sidebar and then "Pages". Here I found the heading "Branch" where you should choose "main" as your branch
