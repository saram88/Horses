# Easy training

Easy training is a website that should support the person who has a motivation to start exercise but dosen´t knows where to start. You maybe never have been on a gym, or never trained at all, and for that target group, this website makes it possible to sign up so you can get access to a gallery with several vdeor, and information that will support a better health, and to actually start training!

## Features 

On my website there is a Home page where I immediately catch the user's attention with the help of starting training. I explain the why´s, how´s and some brief action measures what membership can bring the user for benefits in the long run.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea is to build a community that users can meet other people. Many personal trainers have that today but you need to pay for it, here you can share good idéas to each other at a much lower cost.



### Testing 

I've test-driven the page on validering.w3.org for both my html code and ccs styling. In addition to that, I have tested myself via browser tools for validation. Also have to test on my two different cell phone varieties as well as an ipad.




### Validator Testing

### Unfixed Bugs

I don´t have any unfixed bugs.

## Deployment

When I was inside my project, I went to the little tab called "Settings". From here I pressed the small sidebar and then "Pages". Here I found the heading "Branch" where you should choose "main" as your branch
